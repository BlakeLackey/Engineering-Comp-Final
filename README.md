# Engineering-Comp-Final
# Engineering Computing Final Project (C Language)

This is my final project from my Engineering Computation class at the University of Oklahoma.
It is written in the C programming language and utilizes the KISS Integrated Development Environment.
It is a game similar to the Dinosaur Run game you can find on Google, with an integrated scoreboard.
